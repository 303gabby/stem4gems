      <h5> WHAT DOES STEM STAND FOR? </h5>

      <h4> STEM STANDS FOR SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS. </h4>

      <h5>WHY IS THERE SUCH A HUGE GENDER GAP IN STEM?</h5>

      <h4> - "GENDER STEREOTYPES: STEM FIELDS ARE OFTEN VIEWED AS MASCULINE, AND TEACHERS AND PARENTS OFTEN
        UNDERESTIMATE GIRLS' MATH ABILITIES START AS EARLY AS PRESCHOOL." <h4>

          <h4> - "MALE-DOMINATED CULTURES: BECAUSE FEWER WOMEN STUDY AND WORK IN STEM, THESE FIELDS TEND TO PERPETUATE
            INFLEXIBLE, EXCLUSIONARY, MALE-DOMINATED CULTURES THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF OR ATTRACTIVE TO WOMEN AND
            MINORITIES." <h4>

              <h4> - "FEWER ROLE MODELS: GIRLS HAVE FEWER ROLE MODELS TO INSPIRE THEIR INTEREST IN THESE FIELDS, SEEING
                LIMITED EXAMPLES OF FEMALE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN BOOKS, MEDIA AND POPULAR CULTURE. THERE ARE EVEN
                FEWER ROLE MODELS OF BLACK WOMEN IN MATH AND SCIENCE." <h4>

                  <h4> - " MATH ANXIETY: TEACHERS, WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN, OFTEN HAVE MATH ANXIETY THEY PASS ONTO
                    GIRLS, AND THEY OFTEN GRADE GIRLS NEED TO WORK HARDER TO ACHIEVE THE SAME LEVEL AS BOYS." <h4>

                      <h5> WHAT ARE COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WOMEN IN STEM? </h5>

                      <h4> - "WOMEN ARE INFERIOR TO MEN IN STEM ABILITIES." <h4>

                          <h4> - "MEN ARE NATURALLY MORE INTERESTED IN STEM FIELDS THAN WOMEN." <h4>

                              <h4> - "WOMEN ARE NATURALLY MORE INTERESTED IN CARE GICING OCCUPATIONS." <h4>

                                  <h4> - "WOMEN'S AND MEN'S MATH TEST SCORES ACCURATELY REFLECT THEIR MATH ABILITY."
                                    <h4>

                                      <h4> - "WOMEN CAN'T SUCCESSFULLY BALANCE BEING A SCIENTIST AND HAVING A FAMILY."
                                        <h4>
